\section{Expanding a PRG}
\label{sec:expanding-prg}

In the last lecture we saw the definition of a Pseudorandom Generator
(PRG) as a deterministic function that, given a seed of size $n$,
outputs a pseudorandom string of length $\ell(n)$.  We can ask the
following question: how big can $\ell(n)$ be?  Is there any limit on
how much pseudorandom data we can generate starting from a seed of a
certain size?  We will find out that if we can get a PRG with even
\emph{one bit} of expansion (i.e., $\ell(n) = n+1$), then we can get a
PRG with \emph{any} polynomial output length.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:prg-expansion}
  Suppose that there exists a PRG $G$ with output of length
  $\ell(n)=n+1$.  Then for any $t(n)=\poly(n)$ (where $t(n) > n$),
  there exists a PRG $G_t$ with output length $t(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  The size of the set $\set{G_{t}(s) : s \in \bit^{n}}$ is at most
  $2^n$ (because $G_{t}$ is deterministic), while the number of
  possible $t(n)$-bit string is $|\bit^{t(n)}| = 2^{t(n)}$.  The ratio
  of possible output strings that could actually be output by the PRG
  is at most $2^n/2^{t(n)}= 2^{n-t(n)}$, which is absurdly small when
  $t(n) \geq 2n$ (and even smaller when $t(n) = n^{10}$, say).
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  We will construct $G_t(s)$ from $G$.  Our construction will apply
  the function $G(\cdot)$ $t(n)$ times, outputting one new bit at each
  step and reusing the other $n$ bits of the previous step's output as
  a seed.  See the following picture for intuition about the
  construction.

  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{./prg.jpg}
  \end{figure}

  Formally, $G_t$ is defined as follows (note that it always applies
  $G$ on string of the same length, $n$ bits):
  \begin{algorithm}[h]
    \caption{$G_t(s)$}
    \begin{algorithmic}
      \IF{$t = 0$} \RETURN $\varepsilon$ (the empty string)
      \ELSE \STATE let $(x|b)=G(s)$, where $x \in \bit^{n}$, $b \in \bit$
      \RETURN $b|G_{t-1}(x)$
      \ENDIF
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

  By construction, $|G_t(s)|=t$.  We want to show that $G_t$ is a PRG.
  The function clearly runs in polynomial time (each call to $G$ can
  be resolved in polynomial time and we only use a polynomial number
  of steps), so what's left is to prove that $\set{G_t(U_n)} \compind
  \set{U_{t(n)}}$.  We need to be careful: we already know that $G$ is
  a PRG, but in our construction we are giving a \emph{pseudorandom}
  seed to $G$, instead of a truly random seed.  We will see that this
  fact will not affect the pseudorandomness of $G_t$.  Intuitively,
  because no efficient algorithm can tell a pseudorandom seed apart
  from a random string, then in particular neither can $G$.

  To prove that $G_t$ is a PRG we will define a set of ``hybrid
  experiments.''  We will build a sequence of distributions, where the
  first is equal to our ``real'' construction $G_t(U_{n})$, the last
  is equal to the ``ideal'' truly uniform distribution $U_{t(n)}$, and
  each consecutive pair of distributions are computationally
  indistinguishable.  By the hybrid lemma, we conclude that
  $\set{G_t(U_{n})}$ and $\set{U_{t(n)}}$ are computationally
  indistinguishable and that $G_t$ is a PRG, thus proving the theorem.

  To give some intuition about how we design the hybrid experiments,
  we imagine that instead of invoking the first $G$ on $n$ uniform
  bits, what if we replaced its output with $n+1$ truly uniform bits?
  Intuitively, these two cases should not be distinguishable, because
  $G$ is a PRG.  And then what if we replaced the first two
  invocations of $G$, and so on?  Eventually, we would end up with $t
  = t(n)$ truly uniform output bits, as desired.

  Formally, the hybrid experiments are defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0 = G_t(U_n)$
  \item $H_1 = U_1 | G_{t-1}(U_n)$
  \item In general, $H_i = U_i | G_{t-i}(U_n)$ for $i \in \set{0} \cup
    [t]$
  \item $H_t = U_{t}$
  \end{itemize}

  We now show that for all $i \in [t-1]$, $H_i \compind H_{i+1}$.  We
  will do this by using the simulation/composition lemma, and the fact
  that $G$ is a PRG.  For each $i$, we design a PPT ``simulator''
  algorithm $\Sim_i$ such that $\Sim_i(G(U_n))=H_{i-1}$, and
  $\Sim_i(U_{n+1})=H_i$.  Since we know that $G(U_n) \compind U_{n+1}$
  from the fact that $G$ is a PRG, the composition lemma implies that
  $H_{i-1} \compind H_i$.

  We define $\Sim_i$ as follows:
  \begin{algorithm}[h]
    \caption{$\Sim_i(y \in \bit^{n+1})$}
    \begin{algorithmic}
      \STATE parse $y$ as $(x|b)$ for $x \in \bit^{n}$, $b \in \bit$
      \RETURN $U_{i-1} | b | G_{t-i}(x)$
    \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}

  This algorithm clearly runs in polynomial time.  We need to check
  that it maps $G(U_n)$ to $H_{i-1}$, and $U_{n+1}$ to $H_i$.  First
  suppose that the input of $\Sim_i$ comes from $U_{n+1}$:
  \[ \Sim_i(U_{n+1})= U_{i-1} | b | G_{t-i}(x) = U_{i-1} | U_1 |
  G_{t-i}(U_n)=U_i | G_{t-i}(U_n) = H_i. \] Now suppose that the input
  comes from $G(U_n)$.  By the definition of $G_t$, we can see the
  following:
  \[ \Sim_i(G(U_n)) = U_{i-1} | b | G_{t-i}(x) = U_{i-1} |
  G_{t-i+1}(U_n)=H_{i-1}. \]
  This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\noindent To recap, our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:prg-expansion} took
the following path:
\begin{itemize}
\item We defined a construction: the actual PRG $G_t$ having a
  pseudorandom output of polynomial length.
\item We defined the sequence of hybrid (``imaginary'') experiments.
  In each step, we replaced \emph{one} ``real'' invocation of a crypto
  primitive ($G(U_{n})$) with its ``ideal'' counterpart ($U_{n+1}$).
\item We proved that consecutive pairs of hybrids are computationally
  indistinguishable, using the composition lemma and the security
  properties of the underlying primitives (i.e., that $G$ is a PRG).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To apply the composition lemma, we defined a
    ``simulator'' (reduction) for each pair of adjacent hybrids and
    analyzed its behavior.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Obtaining a PRG}
\label{sec:obtaining-prg}

Thanks to Theorem~\ref{thm:prg-expansion}, we know that all we need is
to obtain a PRG with one extra bit of output.  We describe a
number-theoretic construction, due to Blum and Micali, of such an
object.

\subsection{Number Theory Background}
\label{sec:background}

\begin{theorem}[Euler's theorem]
  \label{thm:euler-thm}
  Let $G$ be a finite abelian (i.e., commutative) multiplicative
  group.  For every $a \in G$, we have $a^{\abs{G}} = 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:euler-thm}]
  Consider the set $A = a \cdot G = \set{ ax\; :\; x \in G}$.  Because
  $G$ is a group, $a$ is invertible, and we have $A = G$.  Taking
  products over all elements in $A = G$, we have \[ \prod_{x \in G}
  (ax) = \prod_{x \in G} x. \] Because $G$ is commutative, the LHS is
  $a^{\abs{G}} \cdot \prod_{x \in G} x$, and we can multiply by the
  inverse of the RHS to obtain $a^{\abs{G}} = 1$.
\end{proof}


When $G = \Zp^{*}$ for a prime $p$, we have $\abs{\Zp^{*}} =
\varphi(p) = p-1$, so we obtain the following corollary:

\begin{corollary}[Fermat's ``little'' theorem]
  Let $p$ be a prime.  For any $a \in \Zp^{*}$, we have $a^{p-1} = 1
  \bmod p$.
\end{corollary}

The following structural theorem will be very useful.  (Its proof is
elementary bur rather tedious, so we won't go through it today.)

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:Zps-cyclic}
  Let $p$ be a prime.  The multiplicative group $\Zp^{*}$ is
  \emph{cyclic}, i.e., there exists some \emph{generator} $g \in
  \Zp^{*}$ such that $\Zp^{*} = \langle g \rangle := \set{g^{1}, g^{2},
    \ldots, g^{p-1}=1}$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Discrete Logarithm Problem and One-Way Function}
\label{sec:dlp-owf}

Theorem~\ref{thm:Zps-cyclic} leads naturally to the so-called
\emph{discrete logarithm problem}, which is: given $y \in \Zp^{*}$
(and prime $p$ and generator $g$ of $\Zp^{*}$), find $\log_{g} y$,
i.e., the $x \in \set{1, \ldots, p-1}$ for which $y = g^{x} \bmod p$.
This problem is believed to be infeasible for large values of $p$.

\begin{conjecture}[Discrete logarithm assumption]
  Let $\algo{S}(1^{n})$ be a PPT algorithm that outputs some prime $p$
  and generator $g$ of $\Zp^{*}$.  For every non-uniform PPT algorithm
  $\Adv$, \[ \Pr_{(p,g) \gets \algo{S}(1^{n}), y \gets \Zp^{*}}
  [\Adv(p,g,y) = \log_{g} y] = \negl(n). \]
\end{conjecture}

We would like to design a collection of OWFs based on the discrete
logarithm assumption.  The collection is made up of the functions
$f_{p,g} : \set{1, \ldots, p-1} \to \Zp^{*}$ (for prime $p$ and
generator $g$ of $\Zp^{*}$), defined as \[ f_{p,g}(x) = g^{x} \bmod
p. \] Moreover, these functions are even \emph{permutations} if we
identify $\set{1, \ldots, p-1}$ with $\Zp^{*}$ in the natural way.

It is a tautology that the collection is one-way under the discrete
logarithm assumption.  It is also clear that we can efficiently sample
from the domain of $f_{p,g}$.  But we still need to check that
$f_{g,p}$ can be evaluated efficiently, and that $(p,g)$ can be
generated efficiently.

For the first, we use the standard ``repeated squaring'' technique for
exponentiation, which requires $O(\len{x})$ multiplications modulo
$p$.  The solution to the second issue is not entirely
straightforward.  Given only the prime $p$, it is unknown (in general)
how to find a generator $g$ of $\Zp^{*}$ efficiently.  However, given
the \emph{factorization} of $p-1$, which can be generated along with
$p$, it is possible: every element in $\Zp^{*}$ has order dividing
$p-1$, so $g$ is a generator if and only if $g^{(p-1)/q} \neq 1 \bmod
p$ for every prime divisor $q$ of $p-1$.  The number of non-generators
is at most the sum of $(p-1)/q$ over all prime divisors $q$ of $p-1$,
so the density of generators is typically large enough.  An often-used
special case is $p = 2q+1$ for prime $q$, for which there are $q =
(p-1)/2$ generators.  However, it is not even known whether there
exist infinitely many such ``Sophie Germain'' primes of this form!
(Empirically, though, they are abundant.)

\subsection{Blum-Micali PRG}
\label{sec:blum-micali-prg}

We now present a PRG that uses the ideas presented in the previous
section.  From Section~\ref{sec:expanding-prg} we know that if we have
a PRG that is able to generate one extra bit of randomness, we can
generate a polynomial number of pseudorandom bits.  Our goal will be
the following: we want to construct a PRG $G_{p,g} \colon \Zp^* \to
\Zp^* \times \bit$.\footnote{To be pedantic, $G_{p,g}$ is a
  ``collection'' of PRGs, where the input seed comes from a set that
  depends on the function index $(p,g)$.  It it easy to check that our
  construction from Section~\ref{sec:expanding-prg} is compatible with
  this collection $G_{p,g}$.}

Our solution is a function with the following form: \[ G_{p,g}(x)=
(f_{p,g}(x)=g^x \bmod p \quad, \quad h(x)). \] Note that $f_{p,g}(x)$
performs the modular exponentiation function (which is a one-way under
the discrete log assumption), while $h \colon \Zp^{*} \to \bit$ is
some function (yet to be defined) that provides the additional bit.

Looking at the function, we can make the following observation: if $x
\in \Zp^{*}$ is chosen uniformly at random, then also $f_{p,g}(x)$ is
uniform (because $f_{p,g}$ is a permutation).  We still need to choose
the function $h$, keeping in mind what we want from from the function:
$h(x)$ should ``look like a random bit,'' \emph{even given
  $f_{p,g}(x)$}.  That is, $h(x)$ should compute ``something about
$x$'' that $f$ hides \emph{completely}.

We can think of many possible candidates for $h$: apply the xor
function to all the bit of $x$; take the least significant bit of $x$
(though you will show that this \emph{does not} meet our
requirements!); take the ``most significant bit'' of $x$ (more
precisely, test if $x>\frac{p-1}{2}$).  The last function will be the
one we will use.

Let's formalize the security properties we want from $h(x)$: given
$f(x)$, no algorithm should be able to guess $h(x)$ with much better
than $\frac{1}{2}$ probability.

\begin{definition}[Hardcore predicate]
  \label{def:hard-core-pred}
  A predicate $h: \bit^* \to \bit$ is \emph{hard-core} for $f$ if for
  all non-uniform PPT algorithms $\Adv$,
  \[ \Pr_{x}[\Adv(f(x))=h(x)] \leq \frac{1}{2} + \negl(n). \]
\end{definition}

\emph{Exercise}: Prove that if $h$ is hard-core for a one-way
permutation $f:D \to D$, then \[ (f(x),h(x)) \compind (U(D),U_1), \]
where $x \gets D$.  This means that $G(x)=(f(x),h(x)) \in D \times
\bit$ is a PRG that expands by one bit.

Next time, we will show that under the discrete log assumption, the
``most significant bit'' predicate $h(x) = [x > \frac{p-1}{2}]$ is
hard-core for $f_{p,g}$.
